The Real time hardware monitoring and analysis system is a system built using Big Data stack that is Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch. the goal of this system is to stream the hardware logs which contains crucial sensor data, analyze them and help predict performance limiting reasons such as CPU core thermal throttling and CPU power limit throttling. the system also uses flask for backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the frontend for dynamic dashboard that provides the system status in real-time. the system also uses elasticsearch as its storage and querying system. its my current flagship project as it encompasses all my knowledge in the domain of Big Data tools, frontend, backend development, system stability and benchmarking. 
In this project I have done everything from figuring out big data tool versions by grinding against VMs, docker containers and more so that spark, kafka and elasticsearch dont fight each other to integrating all the tools, making the dashboard, training a custom AI model using randomForest model for performance limiting predictions to developing system architecture and designing the processing pipeline. this project defines my progress with coding, and understanding of computer systems.
