You can find the IP address of a Docker container using a few different methods. Here are some common ways:

Using docker inspect:

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container_name_or_id>
Replace <container_name_or_id> with the name or ID of your container. This command extracts the IP address directly from the container's network settings.

Using docker exec:

docker exec <container_name_or_id> hostname -I
This command runs hostname -I inside the container, which returns the IP address.

Using docker network inspect:

docker network inspect <network_name>
This command provides detailed information about the network, including the IP addresses of all connected containers. Replace <network_name> with the name of the Docker network.
